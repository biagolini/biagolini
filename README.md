# About me

Hi, I'm Carlos Biagolini-Jr, a Cloud Architect specializing in AWS at OpsTeam. My journey began in the academic world, where I studied Biological Sciences at Universidade Federal de Lavras (UFLA), earned a master's degree in conservation from Universidade Federal de São Carlos (UFSCar), and completed a Ph.D. in Ecology at Universidade de Brasília (UnB). However, I transitioned into the tech industry to broaden my career horizons and began pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Instituto Federal de São Paulo (IFSP) (currently in progress).

During my research career, I published approximately 20 articles, some in top-tier journals, and developed R packages to address field biologists' challenges in my former area of study. If you are interested in my Biology articles, you can check the list of papers that I published in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WPJugvoAAAAJ&hl).

## Experience

As a Cloud Architect, my daily work involves supporting developers and system maintainers in launching new services and maintaining existing ones hosted on AWS. I'm constantly seeking ways to improve cost efficiency and security in cloud services.

## Expertise
My main areas of expertise and study include:
- AWS
- Boto3
- Terraform
- Python
- FinOps
- Information Security

## Interests

I'm passionate about how cloud technologies and artificial intelligence can revolutionize the world. As a result, I'm constantly exploring and learning about new advancements in these areas.

# About my Github

Outside of my work as a Cloud Architect, I am an avid learner (a proud nerd) and enjoy sharing knowledge, a habit I developed during my previous career as a researcher. One motivation behind creating and sharing tutorials on my GitHub is to strengthen my understanding of various topics. Educational psychologists have demonstrated that preparing a presentation or tutorial leads to better information retention compared to passive study activities, such as rereading material (Roediger & Karpicke 2006; Karpicke 2017). In addition, these tutorials serve as a collection of "notes" for solving day-to-day techonologies challenges.

I organize my tutorials into repositories based on the primary technology involved, following this naming convention: the main technology as a prefix, followed by a description of the tutorial's content. While older repositories might not always include a README with instructions on how to test the code, I am working on updating them. All new repositories are published with the tutorial included in the README. 

## Tutorials

I've created a collection of tutorials on various technologies, which you can find in the repositories below:
